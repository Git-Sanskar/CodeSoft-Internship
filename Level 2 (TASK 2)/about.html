                HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using the markup language.
                HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the web
                pages and markup language defines the text document within the tag that define the structure of web
                pages.<br><br>
                HTML Basic Format Page Structure -:<br>
                The basic structure of an HTML page is laid out below. It contains the essential building-block elements
                (i.e. doctype declaration, HTML, head, title, and body elements) upon which all web pages are
                created.<br>
                1) DOCTYPE HTML - A doctype or document type declaration is an instruction that tells the web browser
                about the markup language in which the current page is written. It is not an element or tag. The doctype
                declaration is not case-sensitive.<br>
                2) html - This tag is used to define the root element of HTML document. This tag tells the browser that
                it is an HTML document. It is the second outer container element that contains all other elements within
                it.<br>
                3) head - This tag is used to define the head portion of the HTML document that contains information
                related to
                the document. Elements within the head tag are not visible on the front-end of a webpage.<br>
                4) body - The body tag is used to enclose all the visible content of a webpage. In other words, the body
                content is what the browser will show on the front end.<br>

                <p id="pt1">CSS</p>CSS(Cascading Style Sheets)is used to apply styles to web pages. Cascading Style
                Sheets are fondly referred to as CSS. It is used to make web pages presentable. The reason for using
                this is to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. It allows you to apply styles on web
                pages. More importantly, it enables you to do this independently of the HTML that makes up each web
                page.<br><br>
                Why we learn CSS -:<br>
                Styling is an essential property for any website. It increases the standards and overall look of the
                website that makes it easier for the user to interact with it. A website can be made without CSS, as
                styling is MUST since no user would want to interact with a dull and shabby website. So for knowing Web
                Development, learning CSS is mandatory.<br><br>
                There are three types of CSS which are given below -:<br>
                Inline: Inline CSS contains the CSS property in the body section attached with the element known as
                inline CSS.<br>
                Internal or Embedded: The CSS ruleset should be within the HTML file in the head section i.e the CSS is
                embedded within the HTML file.<br>
                External: External CSS contains a separate CSS file that contains only style property with the help of
                tag attributes.

                <p id="pt1">JavaScript</p>JavaScript is the most popular lightweight, interpreted compiled
                programming language. It can be used for both Client-side as well as Server-side developments.
                JavaScript also known as a scripting language for web pages.<br><br>
                JavaScript can be added to your HTML file in two ways -:<br>
                Internal JavaScript<br>
                External JavaScript<br><br>
                1) Internal JavaScript: We can add JS code directly to our HTML file by writing the code inside the
                script tag. The script tag can either be placed inside the head or the body tag according to the
                requirement.<br>
                2) External JavaScript: We can create the file with a .js extension and paste the JS code inside of it.
                After creating the file, add this file in
                script src=”file_name.js” tag, and this sctipt tag can import inside head tag or body tag of the HTML
                file.

                <p id="pt1">PHP</p>The term PHP is an acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor. PHP is a server-side
                scripting language designed specifically for web development. It is open-source which means it is free
                to download and use. It is very simple to learn and use. The files have the extension “.php”.<br><br>
                Rasmus Lerdorf inspired the first version of PHP and participated in the later versions. It is an
                interpreted language and it does not require a compiler.<br><br>
                PHP code is executed in the server.<br>
                It can be integrated with many databases such as Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL,
                Sybase, and Informix.<br>
                It is powerful to hold a content management system like WordPress and can be used to control user
                access.<br>
                It supports main protocols like HTTP Basic, HTTP Digest, IMAP, FTP, and others.<br>
                Websites like www.facebook.com and www.yahoo.com are also built on PHP.<br>
                One of the main reasons behind this is that PHP can be easily embedded in HTML files and HTML codes can
                also be written in a PHP file.<br>
                The thing that differentiates PHP from the client-side language like HTML is, that PHP codes are
                executed on the server whereas HTML codes are directly rendered on the browser. PHP codes are first
                executed on the server and then the result is returned to the browser.<br>
                The only information that the client or browser knows is the result returned after executing the PHP
                script on the server and not the actual PHP codes present in the PHP file. Also, PHP files can support
                other client-side scripting languages like CSS and JavaScript.
