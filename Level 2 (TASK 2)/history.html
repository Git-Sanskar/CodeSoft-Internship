                The first version of HTML was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993. Since then, there have been many
                different versions of HTML. The most widely used version throughout the 2000's was HTML 4.01, which
                became an official standard in December 1999.

                Another version, XHTML, was a rewrite of HTML as an XML language. XML is a standard markup language that
                is used to create other markup languages. Hundreds of XML languages are in use today, including GML
                (Geography Markup Language), MathML, MusicML, and RSS (Really Simple Syndication). Since each of these
                languages was written in a common language (XML), their content can easily be shared across
                applications. This makes XML potentially very powerful, and it's no surprise that the W3C would create
                an XML version of HTML (again, called XHTML). XHTML became an official standard in 2000, and was updated
                in 2002. XHTML is very similar to HTML, but has stricter rules. Strict rules are necessary for all XML
                languages, because without it, interoperability between applications would be impossible. You'll learn
                more about the differences between HTML and XHTML in Unit 2.

                Most pages on the Web today were built using either HTML 4.01 or XHTML 1.0. However, in recent years,
                the W3C (in collaboration with another organization, the WHATWG), has been working on a brand new
                version of HTML, HTML5. Currently (2011), HTML5 is still a draft specification, and is not yet an
                official standard. However, it is already widely supported by browsers and other web-enabled devices,
                and is the way of the future.

                <p id="pt1">CSS</p>Along with HTML, CSS is also standardized by W3C that controls the web standards. CSS
                is free to use, independent and it is also an open-source standard. And users can use HTML and CSS
                together with the W3C.
                If we look at the history of CSS, we will find it has seen mainly three updates. CSS level 1 was
                launched in 1996, and it came again in 1999 with some improvements. However, CSS level 2 or CSS2 came in
                1998 with media support. In this version, the user can utilize the other media elements. And finally,
                its latest version, CSS level 3, launched, and currently, we use this version only. The latest version
                of CSS allows us to take advantage of separation that helps in saving time.

                If you need to make some critical changes on a large website with hundreds of pages. Currently, CSS
                comes with over 60 modules with different features. In recent years, most developers and designers have
                tried a variety of browsers to see the effects of CSS on web pages. But most of them found Firefox as
                the most helpful for the same concern.

                <p id="pt1">JavaScript</p>In September 1995, Brendan Eich, a programmer at Netscape developed a
                programming language in just 10 days.
                This language was initially called Mocha, then LiveScript.
                In December 1995 Netscape and Sun(the organisation that owned Java) had a license agreement regarding
                Javascript(then LiveScript) hence it was renamed to Javascript and specifically "Java" script because
                Java was the most popular language at that time and this would help the marketing of Javascript as well.
                Javascript grew rapidly since then and in 1997 ECMA was given the responsibility to create a
                specification for the language (more on this in What is 'ECMAscript and how is javascript related to
                it?' section)
                Today Javascript is used by millions of developers and is used in major sites such as Google, Facebook,
                Twitter, etc.

                <p id="pt1">PHP</p>Originally (it is believed) the letters stood for Personal Home Page. The first work
                was done by Rasmus Lerdorf and dates back to about 1994. Lerdorf originally used it for his personal
                page specifically to track visitors. Soon, a lot of additional functions were added. It took a few
                years, though, for it to become a language and not just a set of tools.

                The code was released in the mid-1990s. Israels Andi Gutmans and Zeev Suraski did a major overhaul in
                1997 with the goal of using PHP to run an eCommerce site. Their version, termed PHP 3.0, had more of the
                features we expect and see today.

                The same duo later created Version 4.0. 2004 saw another major revision, PHP 5.0. Although there has not
                yet been a 6.0, there have been significant improvements since 5.0, including the removal of several
                things that had caused instability or potential security breaches.
